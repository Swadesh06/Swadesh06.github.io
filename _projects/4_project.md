## Overview

This open research project, conducted in collaboration with the Vision and Language Group, focuses on developing robust methods for identifying AI-generated text and enhancing system resilience against artificially generated content.

## Project Details

**Duration:** December 2023 â€“ January 2024  
**Collaboration:** Vision and Language Group  
**Code Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Swadesh06/LLM-AI-Genrated-Text-Classification)

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Detection Accuracy:** Develop highly accurate classifiers to distinguish between human and AI-generated text
2. **Robustness Enhancement:** Build systems resistant to adversarial attacks and evasion techniques
3. **Generalization:** Create models that work across different AI text generation systems

## Technical Approach

### Machine Learning Methods
- Implemented advanced NLP techniques for text analysis
- Developed feature extraction methods specific to AI-generated content patterns
- Applied ensemble learning approaches for improved detection accuracy

### Robustness Strategies
- Investigated adversarial robustness against sophisticated evasion attempts
- Developed techniques to handle evolving AI generation methods
- Implemented cross-domain validation for generalization

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Evolving AI Models:** Adapting to increasingly sophisticated text generation models
2. **Subtle Patterns:** Detecting subtle linguistic markers that distinguish AI from human text
3. **Domain Adaptation:** Ensuring performance across different text types and domains
4. **Adversarial Robustness:** Maintaining accuracy against deliberate evasion attempts

## Applications

### Academic Integrity
Supporting educational institutions in maintaining academic honesty by detecting AI-assisted submissions.

### Content Verification
