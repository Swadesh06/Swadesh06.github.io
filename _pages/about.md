I am an undergraduate researcher in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), with a deep passion for Computer Vision, Diffusion Models, and AI Safety. My research focuses on Generative AI, Interpretability, and Vision-Language Model robustness.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with leading research institutions and industry partners, including [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), [AuraML](https://www.auraml.com/), [Ernst and Young](https://www.ey.com/en_in), [IIIT Hyderabad](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), [IIT Bombay](https://www.kcdh.iitb.ac.in/), and [BOSCH](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) through various research internships and projects. My work spans across diverse areas including circuit tracing interpretability in LLMs, text-to-3D scene generation, business workflow optimization, and multi-task reinforcement learning.

Currently, I am pursuing research in geometric manipulation of latent manifolds in Diffusion Models and developing frameworks for better interpretability in generative vision models. I have published work at top-tier venues including TMLR, NeurIPS workshops, and have received recognition including the Best Paper Award at MLRC 2025.
